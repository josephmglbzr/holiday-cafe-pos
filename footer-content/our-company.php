    <p>Holiday Cafe and Souvenir Shop is a medium-sized company in the Philippines. Born as a dream 
        of its owner who loves enjoying holidays, it is a cafe that adapts its theme and ambiance based
         on the different holidays in the Philippines and worldwide. It currently has 500 baristas, pastry 
         chefs, and cooks, 500 cashiers, and other crews, 150 store managers, distributed to the twenty-five 
         (25) branches, and an estimated 300 head office workers including an IT department. The smallest branch 
         is in Lucban, Quezon, which can accommodate 150 dine-in customers at one sitting while the largest branch 
         in Cainta Rizal can handle 335 dine-in customers at one instance. Of course, the take-out and delivery orders 
         make the daily sales double or even triple in volume.
        Holiday Cafe and Souvenir Shop operates from Monday to Sunday from 6:00 AM-12:00MN including all holidays
        in all branches. It was recently awarded to be one of the companies for generous benefits and compliance with labor law and 
        other related national policies. Besides being a ”Blockbuster” Cafe, each branch has a souvenir shop where customers can also buy 
        holiday souvenirs and decorations, an innovative business approach to customers who want to relax and at the same time, shop items that they want 
        to display to celebrate different holidays.
